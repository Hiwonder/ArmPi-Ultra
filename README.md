## Product Overview

ArmPi Ultra is a desktop-level AI 3D vision robotic arm developed by Hiwonder for ROS education scenarios. It integrates a 3D depth camera with robotic arm control, combining 3D vision technology with precise manipulation. Equipped with 6 high-torque smart bus servos, Raspberry Pi 5 main controller, multifunctional expansion board, AI voice interaction box and other high-performance hardware, it utilizes built-in advanced kinematics algorithms to not only achieve 3D motion control but also accurately recognize, track, and grasp target objects in three-dimensional space.

ArmPi Ultra deploys multimodal AI large models that combine 3D vision, voice or text to deeply understand the environment, plan actions and flexibly execute tasks, enabling more advanced embodied intelligence applications. Through the Raspberry Pi CPU, it can perform machine learning model training, easily implementing various AI creative projects such as waste classification, object recognition, face recognition, and human feature recognition.

ArmPi Ultra adopts an exquisite modular design that supports multimodal expansion. Combined with Mecanum wheels, it can transform into a mobile handling robot to achieve mobile grasping and intelligent transportation functions. ArmPi Ultra also supports electric slide rail and electric conveyor belt expansion, allowing free construction of dual-arm collaboration, object sorting and other automation projects, applicable to diverse application scenarios!
